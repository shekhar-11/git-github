-git -- version control 
		github, gitlab, bitbucket all works over git and provides their own facilities

git - version control s/w, cli    and github - platform , gui
i


fs can't recover while git can recover and rollback


Basic Git Commands -


	#git init 
	-- initialize a git repo in local

	#git add filename 
	-- from untracked to staged
	#git rm --cached filename 
	-- staged to untracked again
	#git commit -m "MSG"  
	-- staged to tracked


	if(just removed from the local)
	#git restore filename 
	-- restore the file from vcs (check the deleted from git status)
	
	if(removed from vcs) -- 
	#git rm filename
	#git restore --staged filename    
	-- unstages the deletion
	#git checkout -- filename	
	--  restores the file from the last commit

	#git push 
	-- local to remote github(as it is remote)

	#git remote add origin url 
	-- to add the remote access for the repo ie to connect to the remote
	#git remote -v  
	-- to check the remote access url


	whenever we create a branch on local -- master
	on github -- main


	(((developer setting -> create token --> copy -->   git remote set-url origin "url"   connects the github))))

	

	#clone 
	-- github to local
	#fork
	 --  github to github copy ----  
	

	sync fork to balance the changes on github
 
	
	#git pull origin branch_name
	 to bring the changes from github to local
	#git push origin branch_name 
	 to push to particular branch (main for github and master for local or other can be created too)



	





>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>BRANCHES<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Branches -- 
		helps in providing the isolation
		same code copies in local --- branches
	
	root / first -- on local -- master
	root / first -- on github -- main

	
	#git branch 
	- tells about branch
	#git checkout -B dev 	
	--  -B means new branch name dev 			
	--checkout---switch to that branch

	#git switch branch_name


	main code is always in master -- working code is given here
	another same codes in staging --- testing 
	same code in dev branch -- development ------
							a feature branch is created from this dev
							so as to add value to diff features of the project




	#git log 
	--
	head --> latest commit in the particular branch
	#git log --oneline


	git checkout/switch branch_name



	[]--->[] --> [head of master branch] 
		     |
		     |
		    []--> [head of dev branch] 

	Merge the dev to master(on github)
		pull rqst -> base is to which the branch to be merged
			     compare is the branch which has to be merged
			     create pr

	else
	#git checkout BASE_BRANCH
	# git merge to_be_meged_branch

	fetch --- to bring all branches to local
	pull -- to bring all changes specific to particular branch to local





	
	>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>HOOKS<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

	hooks are for testing before pushing the code --- precommit test
	eg - error in code or unused variables for python can be tested using --- flake8



	create a file in hooks of .git folder
	pre-commit or pre-push ............

	#files = files=$(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep '\.py$')  
	--to filter out the files with .py file 

	#flake8 $files	
	--to test the files 

	make this file executable then just try commits	
	similarly we can use other hooks too 


	
	






>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>GITHUB ACTIONS AND WORKFLOWS<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

	For creating CI/CD pipelines like JENKINS
	github actions are the built in tool to BUILD - TEST - DEPLOY the project


	github actions are in .github file of gihub its like git hooks

	#####go through the templates
	
	use the pre-defined templates




>>>>>>>>>>>>>GITHUB DEPLOYMENT OVER GITHUB PAGES<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

write the deployment action and select github actions under settings of repo -> pages -> deployment
handle the error if any
