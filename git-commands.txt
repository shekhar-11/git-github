-git -- version control 
                github, gitlab, bitbucket all works over git and provides their own facilities

git - version control s/w, cli    and github - platform , gui
i


fs can't recover while git can recover and rollback


Basic Git Commands -


        #git init 
        -- initialize a git repo in local

        #git add filename 
        -- from untracked to staged
        #git rm --cached filename 
        -- staged to untracked again
        #git commit -m "MSG"  
        -- staged to tracked


        if(just removed from the local)
        #git restore filename 
        -- restore the file from vcs (check the deleted from git status)

        if(removed from vcs) -- 
        #git rm filename
        #git restore --staged filename    
        -- unstages the deletion
        #git checkout -- filename
        --  restores the file from the last commit

        #git push 
        -- local to remote github(as it is remote)

        #git remote add origin url 
        -- to add the remote access for the repo ie to connect to the remote
        #git remote -v  
        -- to check the remote access url


        whenever we create a branch on local -- master
        on github -- main


        (((developer setting -> create token --> copy -->   git remote set-url origin "url"   connects the github))))



        #clone 
        -- github to local
        #fork
         --  github to github copy ----  


        sync fork to balance the changes on github
 

        #git pull origin branch_name
         to bring the changes from github to local
        #git push origin branch_name 
         to push to particular branch (main for github and master for local or other can be created too)

Branches -- 
                helps in providing the isolation
                same code copies in local --- branches

        root / first -- on local -- master
        root / first -- on github -- main


        #git branch 
        - tells about branch
        #git checkout -B dev 
        --  -B means new branch name dev 
        --checkout---switch to that branch

        #git switch branch_name


        main code is always in master -- working code is given here
        another same codes in staging --- testing 
        same code in dev branch -- development ------
                                                        a feature branch is created from this dev
                                                        so as to add value to diff features of the project




        #git log 
        --
        head --> latest commit in the particular branch
        #git log --oneline


        git checkout/switch branch_name



        []--->[] --> [head of master branch] 
                     |
                     |
                    []--> [head of dev branch] 

        Merge the dev to master
